Welcome,

This project was undertaken to create a memory game for Christian kids.

## Kids Bible Memory Game

The idea of creating this game was birthed from the passion for teaching children Bible truths. As a Sunday School teacher, I believe in "Catching Them Young"; that phrase brings back to memory the title of a school play I acted in at age 9. I strongly believe if we teach children good morals and Bible truths, they will grow up to become great and exceptional leaders in the future. I also find that kids can get bored quite quickly and there is the need to keep them constantly entertained.

As this is an interactive and fun memory game to play, this will help parents, teachers, uncles, aunties, baby-sitters, carers and many more, as I believe this can be used as one of the many fundamental ways of engaging children wherever they are; home, school, church etc so as to reduce boredom and at the same time keep them mentally active as the game will help in exercising their brain.

Thank you and enjoy the ride. :rocket:

## UX

This project is created to meet the needs of kids, parents, teachers, uncles, aunties, baby-sitters, carers and many more,. Below are a few _User Stories_.

* 'As a kid and a potential user, on visiting your site, I want to be able to satisfy the desire to have some fun.'

* 'As a parent, I need an app that will suit my religious beliefs to help keep the kids well engaged and entertained.'

* 'As a Sunday School teacher, I need to be able to the kids engaged at playtime in Sunday School.'

In order to meet the requirements of the users, I began to brainstorm on what to do and how to go about it and deliver the desired result. I then decided to create memory game so I searched and watched a few Youtube videos on how to. These helped me to have a clear understanding on how to construct the plan. I also looked at similar sites created by other code institute students which helped me to make an informed decision. Visiting other sites and watching tutorials really helped me to have a better idea and largely influenced my final decision and I am pleased with the outcome so far.  I also created the wireframe design of the website on Balsamiq (pdf file attached).

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to achieve the requirements of this project:

+ [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
  + CSS3 was used to sytle my website to my desired outcome.
+ [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
  + HTML5 was used as the markup language to structure and present my website on the Web.
+ [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
  + I used this to achieve the interactive part of the game which helps the users have good fun on visiting the website.
  
  
 ## Testing
For my testings, I carried out the following:

+ **Responsiveness Testing**
1. During construction, I regularly test the site against its *Responsiveness* by clicking on **Inspect** to view the developer tool.
2. I then check the layout by clicking on the Ipad, the Iphone and select other devices to view.
3. I also adjusted the pane to view the point at which the design changes to a mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop view.
4. This process helped me to adjust my media queries easily, in order to achieve my desired outcome.

+ **Page Testing**

+ **UX Testing**

+ **HTML5 Testing**

+ **CSS3 and Browsers Testing**

+ **JavaScript Testing**


## Deployment

To deploy my site, I made use of the GitHub hosting platform; GitHub Pages following this process:
1. I logged into [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Under repositories, from the list of projects, I clicked on **Dorcas-Amoo/ms2-project-game** then **Settings**.
3. Under **Settings**, I scrolled down to **GitHub Pages**.
4. From **GitHub Pages**, under **Source**, I clicked on the *dropdown arrow button* and selected **master branch** from the list.
5. Then on top of the **GitHub Pages** section, it states the following:
  + Your site is published at https://dorcas-amoo.github.io/ms2-project-game/
