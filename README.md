Welcome,

This project is undertaken to create a memory game for Christian kids.

## Kids Bible Memory Game

The idea of creating this game was birthed from the passion for teaching children Bible truths. As a Sunday School teacher, I believe in "Catching Them Young"; that phrase brings back to memory the title of a school play I acted in at age 9. I strongly believe if we teach children good morals and Bible truths, they will grow up to become great and exceptional leaders in the future. 

As this is an interactive and fun memory game to play, this will help parents, teachers, uncles, aunties, baby-sitters, carers and many more, as I believe this can be used as one of the many fundamental ways of engaging children wherever they are; home, school, church etc so as to reduce boredom and at the same time keep them mentally active by exercising their brain.

Thank you and enjoy the ride. :rocket:

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to achieve the requirements of this project:

+ [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
  + CSS3 was used to sytle my website to my desired outcome.
+ [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
  + HTML5 was used as the markup language to structure and present my website on the Web.
+ [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
  + I used this to achieve the interactive part of the game which helps the users have good fun on visiting the website.
  
  
  ## Testing
For my testings, I carried out the following:

+ **Responsiveness Testing**
1. During construction, I regularly test the site against its *Responsiveness* by clicking on **Inspect** to view the developer tool.
2. I then check the layout by clicking on the Ipad, the Iphone and select other devices to view.
3. I also adjusted the pane to view the point at which the design changes to a mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop view.
4. This process helped me to adjust my media queries easily, in order to achieve my desired outcome.
