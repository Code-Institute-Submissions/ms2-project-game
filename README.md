Welcome,

This project is undertaken to create a memory game for Christian kids.

## Kids Bible Memory Game

The idea of creating this game was birthed from the passion for teaching children Bible truths. As a Sunday School teacher, I believe in "Catching Them Young"; that phrase brings back to memory the title of a school play I acted in at age 9. I strongly believe if we teach children good morals and Bible truths, they will grow up to become great and exceptional leaders in the future. 

As this is an interactive and fun memory game to play, this will help parents, teachers, uncles, aunties, baby-sitters, carers and many more, as I believe this can be used as one of the many fundamental ways of engaging children wherever they are; home, school, church etc so as to reduce boredom and at the same time keep them mentally active by exercising their brain.

Thank you and enjoy the ride. :rocket:
